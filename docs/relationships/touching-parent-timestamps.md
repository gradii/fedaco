## Touching Parent Timestamps

When a model defines a `belongsTo` or `belongsToMany` relationship to another model, such as a `Comment` which belongs to a `Post`, it is sometimes helpful to update the parent's timestamp when the child model is updated.

For example, when a `Comment` model is updated, you may want to automatically "touch" the `updated_at` timestamp of the owning `Post` so that it is set to the current date and time. To accomplish this, you may add a `touches` property to your child model containing the names of the relationships that should have their `updated_at` timestamps updated when the child model is updated:

    <?php

    namespace App\Models;

    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
    use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

    class Comment extends Model
    {
        /**
         * All of the relationships to be touched.
         *
         * @var array
         */
        protected $touches = ['post'];

        /**
         * Get the post that the comment belongs to.
         */
        public function post(): BelongsTo
        {
            return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);
        }
    }

> [!WARNING]  
> Parent model timestamps will only be updated if the child model is updated using Eloquent's `save` method.
